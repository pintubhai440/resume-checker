## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation**

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

### **1\. Clone the Repository**

git clone \<your-repository-url\>  
cd \<repository-folder-name\>

### **2\. Create a Virtual Environment**

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

\# For Windows  
python \-m venv .venv  
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate

\# For macOS/Linux  
python3 \-m venv .venv  
source .venv/bin/activate

### **3\. Install Dependencies**

Install all the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install \-r requirements.txt

### **4\. Set Up Your API Key**

This application requires a Google AI API key. For security, we use Streamlit's built-in secrets management.

1. Create a folder named .streamlit in your project's root directory.  
2. Inside this folder, create a file named secrets.toml.  
3. Add your API key to this file in the following format:  
   \# .streamlit/secrets.toml

   GOOGLE\_API\_KEY \= "AIzaSy...your...actual...api...key...here"

**Important:** The .gitignore file is configured to ignore the secrets.toml file, so your key will not be accidentally committed to GitHub.

## **‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the App**

Once you have completed the setup, run the following command in your terminal:

python -m streamlit run app.py

The application will open in your default web browser.
